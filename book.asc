* Makers
* "Creative coding community" (artists/designers, etc)
* Programmers looking to work with depth and skeleton info

As with other books focused on Makers, examples in this book will us Processing.  

== Market
* 10 million kinects sold
* fastest selling peripheral of all time
* incredibly active OSS community
* microsoft releasing dev kit
* 70,000 existing users of Processing (http://benfry.com/writing/archives/741[and growing fast])
* Processing is used in too many classrooms to count: <http://openprocessing.org/classrooms/>
* Similar books include
** Making Things Talk
** Getting Started with Processing
** Getting Started with Arduino

== Promotions
* Book will be promoted on Makezine (1.5M unique visitors per year)
* Digital companion piece of labs and projects will be low price, digital compendium of companion projects written in the "Realtime" model.
