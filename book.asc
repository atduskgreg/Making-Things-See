= Making Things See: Kinect and the Coming Vision Revolution

== Audience and Purpose

The goal of this book is to provide technical and conceptual overview necessary to build cool applications with 3D scanner technology, particularly the Kinect.  Most books on this topic are extremely technical and targeted at CS or Engineers types.  This book will make the technology accessible to:

* Makers
* "Creative coding community" (artists/designers, etc)
* Programmers looking to work with depth and skeleton info

As with other books focused on Makers, examples in this book will us Processing.  

== Market
* 10 million kinects sold
* Fastest selling peripheral of all time
* Incredibly active OSS community
* Microsoft releasing dev kit
* 70,000 existing users of Processing (http://benfry.com/writing/archives/741[and growing fast])
* Processing is used in too many classrooms to count: <http://openprocessing.org/classrooms/>

Similar books include
* Making Things Talk
* Getting Started with Processing
* Getting Started with Arduino

== Promotions
* Book will be promoted on Makezine (1.5M unique visitors per year)
* Digital companion piece of labs and projects will be low price, digital compendium of companion projects written in the "Realtime" model.

== Author Bio

After a decade as a musician, web programmer, and startup founder, Greg Borenstein recently moved to New York to become an artist and teacher. His work explores the use of special effects as an artistic medium. He is fascinated by how special effects techniques cross the boundary between images and the physical objects that make them: miniatures, motion capture, 3D animation, animatronics, and digital fabrication. He is currently a grad student at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program.
