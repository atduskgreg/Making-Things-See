== Introduction

Last November, when the Kinect was first released, Matt Webb captured the sense of possibility that had so many programmers, hardware hackers, and tinkerers so excited: http://twitter.com/genmon/status/3066400222478336[WW2 and ballistics gave us digital computers. Cold War decentralisation gave us the Internet. Terrorism and mass surveillance: Kinect.]

The Kinect announces a revolution in technology akin to those that shaped the most fundamental breakthroughs of the 20th Century. Just like the premiere of the personal computer or the Internet, the release of the Kinect was another moment when the fruit of billions of dollars and decades of research that had previously only been available to the military and the intelligence community fell into the hands of regular people.

Face recognition, gait analysis, skeletonization, depth imaging -- this cohort of technologies that had been developed to detect terrorists in public spaces could now suddenly be used for creative civilian purposes: building gestural interfaces for software, building cheap 3D scanners for personalized fabrication, using motion capture for easy 3D character animation, using biometrics to create customized assistive technologies for people with disabilities, etc.

While this development may seem wide-ranging and diverse, it can be summarized simply: for the first time, computers can see. While we've been able to use computers to process still images and video for decades, simply iterating over red, green, and blue pixels misses most of the amazing capabilities that we take for granted in the human vision system: seeing in stereo, differentiating objects in space, tracking people over time and space, recognizing body language, etc. For the first time, with this revolution in camera and image-processing technology, we're starting to build computing applications that take these same capabilities as a starting point. And, with the arrival of the Kinect, the ability to create these applications is now within the reach of even weekend tinkerers and casual hackers.

Just like the personal computer and internet revolutions before it, this Vision Revolution will surely also lead to an astounding flowering of creative and productive projects. The purpose of this book is to provide the context and skills needed to build these projects. Those skills include working with depth information from 3D cameras, analyzing and manipulating point clouds, tracking people with skeletonization and pose detection, and using blob tracking to detect objects. Learning these skills means not just mastering a particular software library or API, but understanding the principles behind them so that you can apply them even as the practical details of the technology rapidly evolve.

And yet mastering these basic skills will not be enough to build the projects that really make the most of this Vision Revolution. To do that you also need to understand some of the wider context of the fields that will be revolutionized by the cheap, easy availability of depth data and skeleton information. To that end, this book will provide introductions and conceptual overviews of the fields of gestural interfaces, 3D scanning, animation, and fabrication, and assistive technology. You can think of these sections as teaching you what you can do with the depth and skeleton information once you've gotten it. They will include topics like building meshes, aligning normals, preparing 3D models for fabrication, defining and detecting gestures, working with motion capture data, displaying and manipulating 3D models, designing custom input devices for people with limited ranges of motion, etc. In covering these topics, our focus will expand outward from simply working with the Kinect to using a whole toolbox of software and techniques.

Obviously, this book will not be a definitive reference to any of these topics; each of them is vast, comprehensive, and filled with its own fascinating intricacies. This book aims to serve as a provocative introduction to each of these areas: giving you enough context and techniques to start using the Kinect to make interesting projects and hoping that your progress will inspire you to follow the leads provided to investigate further.
