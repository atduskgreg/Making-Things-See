== Making Things See Projects [working title]

These projects will be digital companion pieces to the _Making Things See_ book.  Each project will be about the same size and scope as an in-depth blog post of around 5-10 pages (including figures).

The projects will be sold for a fairly low price (certainly under $10, maybe under $5) and will assume that you understand the main concepts in the _Makiong Things See_ book.  The projects should explain enough about how to get you going, but not really delve deeply into  fundamental concepts. 

=== Depth data zoetrope
Make 3d or laser printed zoetrope from depth data. Key concepts:

* printing
* blob tracking
